# Practical Implementation of Embedded SHAP Regularization in Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) within the XAI 2.0 Framework

## 📜 Abstract
We present a method that integrates SHAP-like regularization directly into the training loss of ANFIS.  
The approach simultaneously achieves high predictive accuracy and interpretability by enforcing consistency between local and global explanations while reducing computational overhead compared to traditional post-hoc methods.  
The method is validated on real medical datasets (e.g., Wisconsin Breast Cancer, Heart Disease), demonstrating strong performance and faster training.
